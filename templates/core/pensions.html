  <h2 class="content-h2">What is a pension?</h2>
  <p class="content-para">
    A pension is a way of saving for your retirement, the most common being a workplace pension where you and your employer contribute into a fund. This is then invested and grows over time to support you when you no longer want to or can’t work in the future. 

    In practical terms, 5% of your pay will added to your pension, with your employer matching 3%. These percentages can differ but this is the general idea.

  <h2 class="content-h2">How do I get one?</h2>
  <p class="content-para">
    Often you will have one by default unless you opt out. Although it may be tempting to opt out when you’re early in your career, it’s strongly recommended to opt in. It adds up, and compound interest contributes nicely.

  <h2 class="content-h2">Tax advantage
</h2>
  <p class="content-para">
    Money in your pension comes from your pay, without you paying income tax on it. This means you get more for your money within your pension than you would’ve done if you had taken it as pay. 

    In the basic tax bracket for example, you’ll normally pay £20 in income tax for every £100 earned. In a pension you’d get £100.

  <h2 class="content-h2">Compound Interest
</h2>
  <p class="content-para">
    The earlier you start adding into your pension, the less you have to contribute yourself. The growth of the pension will gradually add far more than your contributions by the time you take it out.

    Compound interest is the interest that you earn on your savings, when it starts earning interest too. As time goes on, your money snowballs and grows rapidly.
    
    Imagine you're a UK citizen named Sarah, and you've been diligently contributing to your pension over the years. You started your pension plan when you were 30 years old and planned to retire at the age of 65.
    Starting Pension Savings: At age 30, you began contributing to your pension fund, investing £200 per month into a workplace pension scheme. You continue this monthly contribution consistently.
    Investment Growth: Over the years, your pension fund is invested in various assets, and it experiences an average annual growth rate of 5%. This is due to the investments made by your pension provider.
    Retirement at 65: When you reach 65, you're ready to retire. You've been contributing for 35 years.
    Let's calculate the value of your pension at the age of 65:

    <ul>
        <li>Monthly Contribution: £200</li>
        <li>Number of Years Contributing: 35</li>
        <li>Average Annual Growth Rate: 5%</li>
    </ul>

    Using a compound interest formula for regular contributions:
The future value of your pension at age 65 can be calculated as follows:
FV = PMT x ((1 + r)^n - 1) / r
Where:
<ul>
    <li>FV is the future value of the pension</li>
    <li>PMT is the monthly contribution (£200)</li>
    <li>r is the monthly interest rate (annual rate / 12 months = 5% / 12 = 0.4167%)</li>
    <li>n is the total number of contributions (35 years x 12 months = 420 months)</li>
</ul>
Now, we can calculate:
FV = 200 x ((1 + 0.004167)^420 - 1) / 0.004167
FV ≈ £152,127.39
So, when you retire at age 65, your pension fund is worth approximately £152,127.39. This is the amount you can use to support yourself during your retirement, and it's a result of your consistent contributions and the growth of your investments over the years. Keep in mind that pension funds can be subject to tax regulations and may have additional features like employer contributions and government benefits, which can further influence your retirement income.

  <h2 class="content-h2">State pension

</h2>
  <p class="content-para">
    As of 23/24, the state pension is £203.85 per week or £10,600.20 per year. State pension age is around 10 years later than private pension access age. 
You do need 10 years of contributions to get the state pension, and a total of 35 years for the full amount.

  <h2 class="content-h2">Personal Pensions (SIPPs)
  </h2>
    <p class="content-para">
        A Self Invested Personal Pension (SIPP) is a pension you can open, managing the investments directly or using a financial adviser. 

        If you’re self employed, it’s a good idea to open a SIPP to save for your retirement.
